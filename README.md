Keylunker
=========

An open-source key-finding program to help you keep track of license keys and important product information stored on your computer.

The idea is to offer a free competitor to something like [RecoverKeys](http://recover-keys.com/) that can be updated for free by the community and will provide a great user experience.

The name is a play on ["spelunker"](http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/spelunker), because I just can't help myself.
