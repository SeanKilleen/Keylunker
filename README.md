Keylunker
=========

An open-source key-finding program to help you keep track of license keys and important product information stored on your computer.

The idea is to offer a free competitor to something like [RecoverKeys](http://recover-keys.com/) that can be updated for free by the community and will provide a great user experience.

The name is a play on ["spelunker"](http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/spelunker), because I just can't help myself.

##Use it For:##
* Backing up product keys for re-use in the event of installing

##Don't Use it For:##
* Stealing or pirating keys. Don't be an ass.
* Circumventing licensing agreements. Again, don't be an ass. Check your license to make sure you can do things like re-install software on additional machines.

##Roadmap##
Eventually, I'd like keylunker to be able to:
* Scan for a ton of software
* Pull a list of currently available software from a central location (i.e. definitions grow automatically)
* Easy export of key lists to a variety of formats
* Notes about licensing (what you can / can't do with a key, for example)
* Contain a wealth of knowledge in the wiki about where these keys come from and how they're obtained.
